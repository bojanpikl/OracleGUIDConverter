* **Oracle RAW(16) GUID Converter**

## Usage

There are two modes of operation. Either by having guid selected, or to enter it in the input window.  

### Convert selection

Select a valid GUID and trigger the action to convert. The selected GUID will be replaced with the converted value. You can select multiple lines of GUID values and they will all be converted at once. Each value will be converted to the opposite value (e.g. RAW(16) to string and vice versa).

### Convert from input

Trigger the action when nothing is selected and a new input will be displayed. Enter a valid GUID and a converted value will be put to the clipboard.

Here you can see both options in action:
